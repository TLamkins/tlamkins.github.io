         <h2>Lamkins Daylily Farm & Nursery</h2>
         <p>
           Lamkins Daylily Farm & Nursery is family owned and operated. The idea for a daylily farm came in 2021, the summer before owner Trey Lamkins started attending college at the University of Nebraska – Lincon to study horticulture. Throughout his entirety of college Lamkins' proceeded to purchase daylily bulbs and seeds. By 2026 he had a collection of xxx varieties available on the property of his family's home. With an established product Lamkins' began to build the business and start selling the lilies online. Now, we are an establish daylily farm and nursery open to visitors of all ages and walks of life who want to purchase a quality plant from a man who knows his stuff.
